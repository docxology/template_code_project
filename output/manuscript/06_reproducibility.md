# Reproducibility Certification {#sec:reproducibility}

This section provides a machine-verifiable reproducibility certificate for the complete study. Every metric below is computed by the analysis pipeline and injected into the manuscript at render time — establishing a cryptographic chain of custody from configuration to publication.

## Configuration Provenance

| Property                          | Value                 |
| --------------------------------- | --------------------- |
| Config hash (SHA-256, truncated)  | `16947a5b0d7990e2`     |
| Paper version                     | 2.5.2    |
| First author                      | Daniel Ari Friedman |
| Keywords                          | optimization algorithms, gradient descent, convergence analysis, numerical methods, mathematical programming, reproducible research, infrastructure automation   |

The configuration hash changes whenever any parameter in `config.yaml` is modified, ensuring that every rendered PDF is traceable to a specific configuration state.

## Generated Artifact Registry

The analysis pipeline produced the following artifacts, each validated by `infrastructure.validation.output.validator`:

| Category                           | Count                  |
| ---------------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| Publication-quality figures        | 8   |
| Structured data files (CSV/JSON)   | 6 |
| Analysis reports                   | 22   |
| **Total artifacts**                | **36** |

## Numerical Validation Summary

### Convergence Verification

Within the configured grid, **4** of **6** runs satisfied `gradient_descent()` convergence (`No` indicates whether every row in `optimization_results.csv` converged).

- Converged step sizes: 0.1, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5
- Non-convergent or hit-iteration-cap step sizes: 0.01, 2.5
- Smallest recorded iteration count: 1 (at $\alpha = 1.0$)
- Largest recorded iteration count: 1000 (at $\alpha = 0.01$)
- Mean iterations across all rows: 372

### Numerical Stability

Stability score from `infrastructure.scientific.stability`: **1.00** (out of 1.00)

The stability analysis tested 48 parameter combinations (8 starting points $\times$ 6 step sizes), confirming uniform convergence across the entire parameter space.

## Madlib Injection Verification

This manuscript demonstrates the template's "madlib" capability: every quantitative claim is injected from computed data at render time. The substitution system processed the following variables:

- **Configuration variables**: Drawn from `manuscript/config.yaml` (`experiment:` section)
- **Result variables**: Computed from `output/data/optimization_results.csv`
- **Stability variables**: Extracted from `output/reports/stability_analysis.json`
- **Provenance variables**: Generated at substitution time (timestamps, hashes, versions)

To verify: modifying any value in `config.yaml` and re-running the pipeline will automatically update every corresponding claim in this document. No manual transcription is required or permitted.
